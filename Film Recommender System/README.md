# Film Recommender System
This project is a content-based recommender system that recommends movies based on the user's preference. The project is built with Python, and it uses a dataset containing a list of movies with their respective features such as the director, genre, and cast. The recommendation engine then utilizes this data to predict the movie a user is most likely to enjoy based on their previously watched movies.

The project's workflow starts with an overview of the different types of recommender systems. Next, the dataset and Jupyter notebook are set up for data preprocessing and vectorization. Afterward, the main function is created, which takes the user's input and recommends the top-rated movies that match their preference.

The frontend of the project is built using Streamlit, which provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their movie preferences. The deployment of the project is done on Heroku, a cloud-based platform that enables seamless deployment and hosting.

To use the application, users can navigate to the web address and input their movie preferences. The recommendation engine then displays the top-rated movies based on their preference.

Overall, this project provides a practical solution to movie recommendations using a content-based approach. The recommendation engine can be easily updated with new movies and features to improve the accuracy of the recommendations. The use of Streamlit and Heroku makes the project easily accessible for anyone with an internet connection.
